# Take-home Code Challenge

:wave: Welcome to W--------- H-----'s Front End Coding Challenge! This challenge is to showcase your knowledge of front-end web development with React.

There are two versions of this test:
1. Front End Engineer
2. Senior Front End Engineer

Complete whichever one you have been directed to take. 

We will build a simple SPA, called **Episode Switcher**, that shows your ability to work with data on the front end. Please code in a [functional / declarative style](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-difference/). Though `for` loops are very fast, for the purposes of this challenge, please avoid using `for`, `forEach`, `for...in`, and `for...of`, and instead use functional array methods. Your app should not 404 or crash, so test everything.

### ðŸ“¼ [Watch a video of the app here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82Ae6JZrv0)

Remember to focus on functionality first, appearances second.

## ðŸ¤¹ Front End Engineer Challenge

Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), and the [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). You may use either Class Components or React Hooks.

## ðŸ§™ Senior Front End Engineer Challenge

Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), **TypeScript**, [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), and the [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). Use React Hooks instead of Class Components. Do not mutate the values of objects or arrays and don't make shallow or deep copies of themâ€”use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) to keep your values immutable. Never use the TypeScript `any` type.


## ðŸš€ Submitting Your Solution

Submit a link to your Github repo. In the README include a link to a live version of the app deployed to Surge, Heroku, or another hosting service you choose.

**There is no time limit, however, we will fill the position as soon as we find the right candidate.**

## ðŸª‚ Test Cases

You should make sure all TV shows load and display properly. We will test at least these shows:

```
Simpsons
Trains
Border Patrol
Blobs
Good Wife
Golfing World
Wedding Central
```

### ðŸ¤ž Good luck!
